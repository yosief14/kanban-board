# kanban-board
I’m prone to hyperfocus when I work which I love but I need to supplement it with an organized framework in order to maximize the benefits and minimize the cons(rabbit holing, and task estimation)

**Problem : Rabbit Hole of Solutions**
I often have a hard time when working on a task keeping track of what exactly I'm doing. I can be working on a bug and end up going down a rabbit hole of searching for suboptimal solutions that distract me from the core issue at hand. This hyper focus is beneficial when I’m on the right track so I want a system to maximize the likelihood that I'm on the right track.  I need a system that helps me orient my intentions when solving problems. 

**Solution: Pomodoro Tech**

I break up my bouts of work with moments of reflection on what I've been doing and ask myself some questions about what I’m trying to do, what are some possible solutions I’m kicking around, pros and cons of each, and how difficult it is to accomplish them. 

**Problem: Task Estimation**

Planning and estimating tasks is crucial in my workflow since having a plan is my biggest motivator. Oftentimes though my estimations are founded on nothing but intuition which is often wrong and when I don’t get it done in the time I estimated I feel disappointed.

**Solution: Better Estimation**

My current system for estimation asks only 2 questions. How hard is this? How long do I think it will take me? Even though there are 2 questions I’m really asking just one because the former determines the latter. I think I have the right Idea when it comes to the final question being “how long does this take?”, but the formula I use to get to it should be improved.

I want to expand the first question using this video as inspiration A better way to estimate
For now I will stick to the suggested categories of complexity, effort, and risk(subject to change). Although Theo is considering how this estimation system works within a team I am not. I’m making this project with the individual in mind rather than the team. 

So my end goal is a kanban board with a pomodoro integration and detailed task estimation features based on Theo T3’s ideas .
